## About the Test Report

This report is automatically generated during CI/CD runs and includes:

- **Test Results**: Pass/fail status for all tests
- **Coverage Data**: Per-test coverage information showing which files and lines each test exercises
- **Execution Time**: Duration for each test
- **Error Messages**: Full error details for failed tests

The report uses the same pytest-llm-report plugin that this documentation describes.
